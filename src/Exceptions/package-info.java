/**
 * EXEPTIONS AND EXCEPTION HANDLING
 * 
 * An Exception is an object created whenever an error occurs.
 * The Exception itself should tell you what specific error occurred.
 * 
 * THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS
 * 
 * 1. Those located in java.lang.RuntimeException
 * 		..These are exceptions during the normal course of running your program.
 * 		..These are for the most part, your responsibility, and you have to catch them.
 * 2.java.lang.Exceptions
 * 		..These are exceptions that are checked by the compiler.
 * 		..You don't have to protect against these errors, as the compiler will warn you and 
 * 		will not actually allow you to run your program until they're resolved.
 * 		..EXAMPLES:
 * 			..ArithmeticException
 * 			..ClassNotFoundExceptioin
 * 			..IllegalArgumentException
 * 			..IndexOutOfBoundsExceptin
 * 			..InputMismatchedException
 * 			..IOException
 *
